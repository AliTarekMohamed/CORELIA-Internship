1. We need to implement malicious file to read the token and call the 'authCallback' function via JavaScript bridge and load it in the web view. But we can't upload the file to webhook and access it because the SOP.

2. The second option is to put the malicious file into the native libraries files.

3. Native libraries compressed with the APK file.

4. If the 'extractNativeLibs' set with true in manifest file, the native libraries will be extracted when the file installed on the device and vice versa.

5. We placed our malicious file in native libraries folder (app/src/main/resources/lib/x86/malicious.html) then build the application and get the APK file.

6. To build our android application we need a key store. This is important for data integrity to make no one able to update our app except who has the key of the application.

7. To create a key run this command in cmd: keytool -genkey -v -keystore research.keystore -alias research_key -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

8. Once the APK installed on the device, the native library folders (our malicious file) will be extracted and we can access it easily.

9. Pass the link to the web view via the intent's extra and the lab will be solved.
