# Cyber Security Internship – CORELIA

## Overview
This repository summarizes my experience and learning outcomes during my **Cyber Security Internship at CORELIA**, where I focused on **web application penetration testing** and **Android application security**.

The internship emphasized both **theoretical understanding** and **hands-on practice**, including building vulnerable environments, exploiting real-world vulnerabilities, and applying proper mitigation techniques.

## Web Application Penetration Testing

During the internship, I gained practical experience in **web pentesting**, including:

- Identifying common web vulnerabilities as they appear in real projects
- Understanding how vulnerabilities are introduced during development
- Exploiting vulnerabilities in controlled lab environments
- Learning and applying proper **mitigation and secure coding practices**

### Practical Work
- Developed **intentionally vulnerable labs** to simulate real-world security issues
- Analyzed how each vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker
- Implemented fixes to understand how vulnerabilities should be mitigated

### External Practice
- Solved multiple labs on **PortSwigger Web Security Academy**

## Android Application Security

In addition to web security, I worked on **Android application penetration testing**, focusing on both static and dynamic analysis techniques.

### Static Analysis
- Performed static analysis using **JADX GUI**
- Reviewed application source code to identify:
  - Insecure configurations
  - Exposed components
  - Hardcoded secrets and sensitive logic

### Dynamic Analysis
- Conducted dynamic analysis using **Frida**
- Hooked runtime functions to:
  - Observe application behavior
  - Bypass security checks in lab environments
  - Understand how vulnerabilities can be exploited at runtime

---

## Conclusion
This internship at **CORELIA** strengthened my understanding of how security vulnerabilities exist in real-world applications, how attackers exploit them, and how developers and security engineers can effectively mitigate them. The hands-on approach significantly enhanced my practical skills in both **web** and **Android application security**.
